This project is mainly to develop a web to make Boston police data accessible to the public and display officersâ€™ misconducts.
We conducted desk research and stakeholder interviews, designed UI of the web, created visualizations and
trend analysis for Forfeiture data, and designed a poster and presented to our stakeholders and to communities who care about civic, legal system, police behaviors, and to our BU - College of Computing and Data Science community.
