This project produced a quantitative analysis of how migrants portrayed in the USA's media. The whole process included web-scraping data from 8 biggest American news agencies, removing duplicate and irrelevant articles, performing Sentiment and Entity Analysis, and constructing a Network graph to visualize relationships among entities based on frequency counts.
