This is a live dashboard for the COVID-19 situation in Vietnam, including statistics for the daily counts and total number of confirmed and death cases as well as the information of vaccination. The platform was implemented with responsive tools that allowed users to zoom in/out, crop and save the charts/graphs, change the variables, and view some additional news and articles.
