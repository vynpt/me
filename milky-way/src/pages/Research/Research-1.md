Be part of MinneMUDAC 2023 Data Challenge, we developed different Machine Learning models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, kNN) to forecast Minnesota Twinsâ€™s home-game attendance. The process involved embedding capture variables relation in feature spaces to improve model performance.
Our final result is a dynamic model using Cat-Boost Gradient Boosting with comparably low MAE score. We were able to identified trends and important factors, analyzed distributions, and provided impactful business insights to our clients (MINTwins).
