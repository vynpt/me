The fellowship program is part of UIUC - National Center for Supercomputing Applications. In this project, we implemented functionality such as creating a CLI tool to output content of the database, verifying tokens and multi-thread safety, handling exceptions, writing tests to ensure correct performance of KeyCache.
The final goal of SciAuth is developing JWTs and improve interoperability for security credentials
